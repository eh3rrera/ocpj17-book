## Answers
**1. The correct answer is C.**

**Explanation:**

- **A)** `Thread thread = new Thread(); thread.start(task);`
  - This option is incorrect because the `start` method does not take a `Runnable` argument. The correct way to associate the `Runnable` task with the thread is to pass it to the `Thread` constructor.

- **B)** `Thread thread = new Thread(task).run();`
  - This option is incorrect because calling `run()` directly on the thread does not start a new thread. It simply executes the `run` method in the current thread.

- **C)** `Thread thread = new Thread(task); thread.start();`
  - This option is correct because it properly creates a new `Thread` object with the `Runnable` task and then starts the thread by calling `start()`.

- **D)** `Thread thread = new Thread(); task.run();`
  - This option is incorrect because it creates a thread without associating the `Runnable` task with it. Additionally, calling `task.run()` directly does not start a new thread; it runs the task in the current thread.

- **E)** `Thread thread = Thread.start(task);`
  - This option is incorrect because `Thread.start` is not a valid static method. The `start` method is an instance method that must be called on a `Thread` object.


**2. The correct answer is B.**

**Explanation:**

- **A)** `synchronized (this) { counter++; }`
  - This option is incorrect because `this` cannot be used in a static context. In the `main` method, `this` is not available. For a static field like `counter`, you need to synchronize on a static object or class.

- **B)** `synchronized (Main.class) { counter++; }`
  - This option is correct because synchronizing on `Main.class` ensures that only one thread can enter the synchronized block at a time for all instances of `Main`, which is appropriate for protecting static fields like `counter`.

- **C)** `synchronized (task) { counter++; }`
  - This option is incorrect because `task` is a `Runnable` object, and synchronizing on it does not effectively control access to the shared static field `counter`.

- **D)** `synchronized (counter) { counter++; }`
  - This option is incorrect because `counter` is a primitive type (`int`), and you cannot synchronize on a primitive type. Synchronization requires an object.

- **E)** `synchronized (System.out) { counter++; }`
  - This option is incorrect because synchronizing on `System.out` is not related to controlling access to `counter`. It would also interfere with other potential uses of `System.out`.


**3. The correct answers are B and C.**   

**Explanation:**

- **A)** `AtomicInteger` is part of the `java.util.concurrent.atomic` package, but it does not provide atomic operations for increment and decrement.
  - This statement is incorrect. `AtomicInteger` provides atomic operations for increment and decrement, such as `incrementAndGet()` and `decrementAndGet()`.

- **B)** `AtomicReference` can only be used with reference types, not primitive types.
  - This statement is correct. `AtomicReference` is designed to work with reference types and cannot be used with primitive types directly.

- **C)** `AtomicLong` supports atomic operations on `long` values, including `getAndIncrement()` and `compareAndSet()` methods. 
  - This statement is correct. `AtomicLong` provides atomic operations on `long` values, including `getAndIncrement()` and `compareAndSet()` methods.

- **D)** `AtomicBoolean` can be used to perform atomic arithmetic operations on `boolean` values.
  - This statement is incorrect. `AtomicBoolean` is used for atomic updates to `boolean` values, but it does not support atomic arithmetic operations.



**4. The correct answer is A.**

**Explanation:**

- **A)** 
```java
lock.lock();
try {
    count++;
} finally {
    lock.unlock();
}
```
  - This option correctly acquires the lock before modifying the shared resource and ensures the lock is released in the `finally` block, which is the proper use of the `Lock` interface.

- **B)** 
```java
lock.lock();
count++;
lock.unlock();
```
  - This option is incorrect because if an exception occurs between `lock.lock()` and `lock.unlock()`, the lock will not be released, potentially causing a deadlock.

- **C)** 
```java
try {
    lock.lock(() -> {
        count++;
    });
} finally {
    lock.unlock();
}
```
  - This option is incorrect because that's not a valid `lock.lock()` call.

- **D)** 
```java
synchronized(lock) {
    count++;
}
```
  - This option is incorrect because the `synchronized` block is used with the `lock` object itself, which is not the correct usage of the `Lock` interface and does not provide the intended functionality.



**5. The correct answer is D.**

**Explanation:**

- **A)** 
```java
executor.shutdownNow();
executor.awaitTermination(1, TimeUnit.MINUTES);
```
  - This option is incorrect because `shutdownNow()` is called first, which attempts to stop all active tasks immediately. The subsequent `awaitTermination()` call is unnecessary and will not work as intended because `shutdownNow()` already attempts to terminate the tasks.

- **B)** 
```java
executor.awaitTermination(1, TimeUnit.MINUTES);
executor.shutdown();
```
  - This option is incorrect because `awaitTermination()` is called before `shutdown()`. The `awaitTermination()` method should only be called after initiating an orderly shutdown with `shutdown()`.

- **C)** 
```java
executor.shutdown();
executor.shutdownNow();
```
  - This option is incorrect because calling `shutdownNow()` immediately after `shutdown()` will cancel all running tasks, making the `shutdown()` call redundant.

- **D)** 
```java
executor.shutdown();
try {
    if (!executor.awaitTermination(1, TimeUnit.MINUTES)) {
        executor.shutdownNow();
    }
} catch (InterruptedException e) {
    executor.shutdownNow();
    Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
}
```
  - This option is correct as it properly initiates an orderly shutdown, waits for tasks to complete within a specified timeout, and forcefully shuts down the executor if the timeout is exceeded. It also correctly handles the `InterruptedException`.



**6. The correct answer is D.**

**Explanation:**

- **A)** 
```java
Future<Integer> future = executor.submit(task);
executor.shutdown();
Integer result = future.get();
System.out.println(result);
```
  - This option is incorrect because `executor.shutdown()` is called before getting the result. While this sequence may work in some cases, it's better practice to shut down the executor after ensuring all tasks have completed and results have been processed.

- **B)** 
```java
Future<Integer> future = executor.submit(task);
Integer result = future.get();
executor.shutdownNow();
System.out.println(result);
```
  - This option is incorrect because `executor.shutdownNow()` immediately attempts to stop all active tasks, which is unnecessary and potentially harmful right after retrieving the result.

- **C)**
```java
Future<Integer> future = executor.submit(task);
System.out.println(future.get(1, TimeUnit.SECONDS));
executor.shutdown();
```
  - This option is incorrect because using `Future.get(long timeout, TimeUnit unit)` without handling possible exceptions (`TimeoutException`, `InterruptedException`, `ExecutionException`) is not a good practice, and it doesnâ€™t ensure the executor is properly shut down if an exception occurs.

- **D)** 
```java
Future<Integer> future = executor.submit(task);
try {
    Integer result = future.get();
    System.out.println(result);
} catch (InterruptedException | ExecutionException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
} finally {
    executor.shutdown();
}
```
  - This option is correct as it properly submits the `Callable` task, retrieves the result using `Future.get()`, handles any `InterruptedException` or `ExecutionException` that might be thrown, and ensures the executor is shut down properly in the `finally` block.



**7. The correct answer is A.**

**Explanation:**

- **A)** `ConcurrentHashMap` allows concurrent read and write operations, and retrieval operations do not block even when updates are being made.
  - This statement is correct. `ConcurrentHashMap` is designed to handle concurrent access, allowing multiple threads to read and write simultaneously without blocking read operations during updates.

- **B)** `CopyOnWriteArrayList` is optimized for scenarios with a high number of write operations compared to read operations. 
  - This statement is incorrect. `CopyOnWriteArrayList` is optimized for scenarios where read operations are far more frequent than write operations because it creates a new copy of the array on each write, which can be costly if writes are frequent.

- **C)** `ConcurrentSkipListSet` does not kept elements sorted.
  - This statement is incorrect. `ConcurrentSkipListSet` keep elements according to their natural ordering, or by a `Comparator` provided at set creation time.

- **D)** `BlockingQueue` implementations like `LinkedBlockingQueue` allow elements to be added and removed concurrently without any internal locking mechanisms.
  - This statement is incorrect. `BlockingQueue` implementations like `LinkedBlockingQueue` do use internal locking mechanisms to handle concurrent access safely.



**8. The correct answer is B.**

**Explanation:**

- **A)** Parallel streams always improve the performance of a program by utilizing multiple threads.
  - This statement is incorrect because parallel streams do not always improve performance. The overhead of managing multiple threads can sometimes outweigh the benefits, especially for small datasets or simple operations.

- **B)** Parallel streams can lead to incorrect results if the operations performed are not thread-safe.
  - This statement is correct. When using parallel streams, care must be taken to ensure that the operations performed on the elements are thread-safe. Failure to do so can lead to race conditions and incorrect results.

- **C)** The order of elements in a parallel stream is always preserved compared to the original stream.
  - This statement is incorrect. The order of elements in a parallel stream is not guaranteed to be the same as in the original stream unless special care is taken to preserve the order, such as using ordered stream operations.

- **D)** Using parallel streams guarantees that the operations on elements will execute in a fixed order.
  - This statement is incorrect because parallel streams do not guarantee the order of execution of operations on elements. The operations may execute in a non-deterministic order due to the concurrent nature of parallel processing.



**9. The correct answer is B.**

**Explanation:**

- **A)** 
```java
int sum = numbers.parallelStream().reduce(1, Integer::sum);
System.out.println(sum);
```
  - This option is incorrect because it uses `1` as the identity value. The identity value for sum should be `0`, as it is the neutral element for addition. Starting the reduction with `1` will result in an incorrect sum that is incremented by `1`.

- **B)** 
```java
int sum = numbers.parallelStream().reduce(0, Integer::sum).collect();
System.out.println(sum);
```
  - This option is correct. It correctly uses `parallelStream()` to create a parallel stream and the `reduce` method with the identity value `0` and the method reference `Integer::sum` to sum the elements.

- **C)** 
```java
int sum = numbers.stream().reduce(0, Integer::sum);
System.out.println(sum);
```
  - This option is incorrect because it uses a sequential stream (`stream()`) instead of a parallel stream. While it correctly sums the elements, it does not demonstrate the use of a parallel stream as specified in the question.

- **D)** 
```java
int sum = numbers.parallelStream().collect(reduce(0, Integer::sum));
System.out.println(sum);
```
  - This option is incorrect because it attempts to use the `collect()` method in combination with `reduce()`, which is not the correct syntax. The `collect()` method is used for mutable reduction and is typically used with collectors, not with the `reduce()` operation directly.
