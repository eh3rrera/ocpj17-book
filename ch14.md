## Introduction to JDBC
Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) is an API for accessing databases from Java. In simple terms, JDBC is like a universal adapter that allows your Java programs to *plug into* and interact with virtually any relational database. If Java is the common language that lets you write a program once and run it anywhere there's a Java Virtual Machine, JDBC is the common language that lets that program talk to any database.

Here's a diagram that shows the overall JDBC architecture:

```

The JDBC API defines a set of Java interfaces to support this architecture:
- `java.sql.Driver`: This interface handles the communication with the database server. You'll need a different driver for each database vendor (Oracle, MySQL, etc.).
- `java.sql.Connection`: Represents a connection with a specific database. SQL statements are executed and results are returned within the context of a connection.
- `java.sql.PreparedStatement`: Represents a precompiled SQL statement. Useful when you plan to execute the same SQL statement many times with high efficiency.
- `java.sql.CallableStatement`: Used to execute stored procedures, which may have input and output parameters.
- `java.sql.ResultSet`: Represents data returned from the database after you execute an SQL statement, kind of like a fancy 2D array.

Almost all the methods of these core JDBC interfaces declare that they may throw an `SQLException`. This is a checked exception that provides information on a database access error or other errors.

An `SQLException` provides the following useful methods:
- `String getMessage()`: Returns a description of the error.
- `String getSQLState()`: Returns a *SQL:2003* standard code identifying the error.
- `int getErrorCode()`: Returns a database vendor-specific error code.

The following diagram shows the workflow of JDBC:

```

A JDBC driver is a software component that enables Java applications to interact with a database. It converts JDBC calls into the specific database protocol required to connect and interact with the database.

To load a JDBC driver, you need to include the driver class (JAR) in your application's classpath. For JDBC 4.0 and later (Java 6 and above), the driver is automatically loaded if the JAR file of the driver is present in the classpath, you don’t need to explicitly load the driver class in your code.

So let's start with the JDBC URL and the `Connection` object.


## Connecting to a Database
The JDBC URL contains all the necessary information to locate and access the database, neatly packaged into a single string.

The format is straightforward:
```java
jdbc:{driver-name}://{server-name}:{port}/{database-name}
```

For example, to connect to an Oracle database named `users` on `localhost`, the JDBC URL might look like:
```java
jdbc:oracle:thin:@localhost:1521:users
```

With the JDBC URL and the database credentials, we can obtain a `Connection` object, either through the `java.sql.DriverManager` utility class or a `javax.sql.DataSource` object.

`DriverManager` is the simpler, more direct path. You load the database driver class, pass the JDBC URL and credentials to `DriverManager.getConnection()`, and you get a `Connection` object:
```java
String url = "jdbc:mydb://localhost:1234/users";
Connection conn = DriverManager.getConnection(url, "username", "password");
```

`DataSource` is a slightly more involved path, designed for use in application servers. You configure a `DataSource` object with the database information and let the application server manage the connections:
```java
Context ctx = new InitialContext();
DataSource ds = (DataSource)ctx.lookup("jdbc/myDB");
Connection conn = ds.getConnection();
```

In any case, once you have a `Connection` object, you're ready to start executing SQL statements and retrieving results.


## Executing Queries
In JDBC, the interaction with the database centers around three types of statements:

- `Statement`: For simple SQL statements without parameters.
- `PreparedStatement`: For precompiled SQL statements, possibly with parameters. Ideal for repeated execution of the same statement with different parameter values.
- `CallableStatement`: For invoking stored procedures in the database.

For one-off, straightforward SQL queries, a simple `Statement` object will suffice. You can create a `Statement` from your `Connection` object with:
```java
Statement stmt = conn.createStatement();
```

And then execute your SQL using one of three methods:

- `ResultSet executeQuery(String sql)`: For `SELECT` statements. Returns a `ResultSet`.  
- `int executeUpdate(String sql)`: For `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, or `DDL` statements. Returns the row count.
- `boolean execute(String sql)`: For any kind of SQL statement. Returns `true` if a `ResultSet` is available, false otherwise.

Here's a quick example:
```java
Statement stmt = conn.createStatement();
ResultSet rs = stmt.executeQuery("SELECT * FROM users");
```

But simple `Statements` have their limitations. They're not very efficient for repeated queries, and they don't allow for parameterization. Here's where `PreparedStatement` comes in.

Think of a `PreparedStatement` as a template for an SQL query. You define the basic structure of the query, with placeholders for parameters, and the database precompiles it. Then you can efficiently execute that query multiple times with different parameter values.

Obtaining a `PreparedStatement` is similar to getting a regular `Statement`, but with your SQL template as a parameter:
```java
String sql = "UPDATE users SET status = ? WHERE id = ?";
PreparedStatement pstmt = conn.prepareStatement(sql);
```

Those `?` symbols are the placeholders for parameters.

It's generally better to use bind variables (the `?` placeholders) instead of concatenating values into your SQL string. This has several benefits:

1. It helps prevent SQL injection attacks. If you concatenate user input directly into your SQL, a malicious user could inject their own SQL commands. Bind variables avoid this risk.

2. It improves performance. When you use bind variables, the database can reuse the parsed and optimized SQL statement, even if the parameter values change. If you concatenate values into the SQL, the database has to parse and optimize the statement every time.

Now, executing a `PreparedStatement` is a little different. Instead of passing the SQL to the execute method, you first set the parameter values using setter methods like `setString()`, `setInt()`, etc. The parameters are numbered starting from `1`.  
```java
pstmt.setString(1, "active");
pstmt.setInt(2, 1234);
```

Then you call one of the execution methods (`executeQuery()`, `executeUpdate()`, or `execute()`) just like with a simple `Statement`.
```java
int rowCount = pstmt.executeUpdate();
```

But what happens if we use the wrong execution method for our SQL statement? For example, what if we use `executeQuery()` for an UPDATE statement?

You'll receive an `SQLException`. As a rule of thumb:
- Use `executeQuery()` for `SELECT` statements
- Use `executeUpdate()` for `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, or `DDL` statements 
- Use `execute()` if you're not sure what type of result your statement will return

One of the key benefits of `PreparedStatements` is the ability to batch multiple statements together for execution. This can dramatically improve performance when you need to execute many similar statements.

Suppose you need to insert a thousand rows into the `users` table. With simple `Statements`, you'd have to execute a thousand individual `INSERT` statements. But with `PreparedStatements` and batching, you can do it much more elegantly:
```java
PreparedStatement pstmt = conn.prepareStatement("INSERT INTO users VALUES (?, ?)");
for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
    pstmt.setString(1, "user" + i);
    pstmt.setString(2, "password" + i);
    pstmt.addBatch();
}
int[] rowCounts = pstmt.executeBatch();
```

The `addBatch()` method adds the current set of parameters to the batch, and `executeBatch()` executes all the accumulated statements in one fell swoop.
 
For even more power and flexibility, JDBC allows you to call stored procedures in your database using `CallableStatements`. Stored procedures can have `IN`, `OUT`, and `INOUT` parameters, and `CallableStatements` handle them all.

To call a procedure with no parameters, the process is straightforward:
```java
CallableStatement cstmt = conn.prepareCall("{CALL procedureName}");
cstmt.execute();
```

For procedures with parameters, use the setter and getter methods corresponding to the parameter types. Let's look at examples for `IN`, `OUT`, and `INOUT` parameters.

Passing an `IN` parameter:
```java
CallableStatement cstmt = conn.prepareCall("{CALL procedureName(?)}");
cstmt.setString(1, "value");
cstmt.execute();
```

Getting an `OUT` parameter:
```java
CallableStatement cstmt = conn.prepareCall("{CALL procedureName(?)}");
cstmt.registerOutParameter(1, java.sql.Types.VARCHAR);
cstmt.execute();
String result = cstmt.getString(1);
```

And for an `INOUT` parameter, you use both a setter and a getter:
```java
CallableStatement cstmt = conn.prepareCall("{CALL procedureName(?)}");
cstmt.setString(1, "inValue");
cstmt.registerOutParameter(1, java.sql.Types.VARCHAR); 
cstmt.execute();
String result = cstmt.getString(1);
```


## Retrieving Results from a `ResultSet`
While `Statements` and `PreparedStatements` are about sending data and commands to the database, `ResultSets` are all about retrieving data from the database. They represent the rows and columns returned by a SQL query.

Reading a `ResultSet` is like iterating over a 2D array, you have a cursor that moves from row to row, and, for each row, you can access the columns by index or by name. The cursor starts before the first row, so you need to call `next()` to move to the first row.

Here's a basic example:
```java
ResultSet rs = stmt.executeQuery("SELECT id, name FROM users");
while (rs.next()) {
    int id = rs.getInt("id");
    String name = rs.getString("name");
    // do something with the data
}
```

The `ResultSet` provides getter methods for all the common data types: `getInt()`, `getString()`, `getDouble()`, `getDate()`, etc. You can retrieve a column value by its index (starting from `1`) or by its name.

By default, `ResultSets` are forward-only and read-only. This means you can only move forward through the rows using `next()`, and you can't update the data in the `ResultSet`. However, JDBC allows you to create `ResultSets` with different capabilities by passing type and concurrency options to the `createStatement()` or `prepareStatement()` methods.

The type options are:

- `ResultSet.TYPE_FORWARD_ONLY`: This is the default. You can only move forward through the `ResultSet` using `next()`.
- `ResultSet.TYPE_SCROLL_INSENSITIVE`: You can move forward and backward through the `ResultSet` using methods like `next()`, `previous()`, `first()`, `last()`, etc. The `ResultSet` does not reflect changes made to the underlying database after it was created.  
- `ResultSet.TYPE_SCROLL_SENSITIVE`: Like `TYPE_SCROLL_INSENSITIVE`, but the `ResultSet` reflect changes made to the underlying database.

The concurrency options are:

- `ResultSet.CONCUR_READ_ONLY`: This is the default. You cannot update the data in the `ResultSet`.
- `ResultSet.CONCUR_UPDATABLE`: You can update the data in the `ResultSet` using methods like `updateString()`, `updateInt()`, etc., and then call `updateRow()` to update the underlying database.

Here's an example of creating a scrollable, updatable `ResultSet`:
```java
Statement stmt = conn.createStatement(
    ResultSet.TYPE_SCROLL_INSENSITIVE, 
    ResultSet.CONCUR_UPDATABLE);

ResultSet rs = stmt.executeQuery("SELECT * FROM users");

// Move to the last row
rs.last();

// Update the name in the current row
rs.updateString("name", "New Name");
rs.updateRow();
```

These options give you a lot of flexibility in how you work with the data retrieved from your database.


## Using Transactions
Imagine you're transferring money from one bank account to another. This involves two steps: debiting the amount from the source account, and crediting it to the destination account. Now, what if something goes wrong after the debit but before the credit? You'd have an inconsistency in your data and money would be lost!

This is where transactions come in. A transaction is a sequence of database operations that are treated as a single unit of work. Either all of the operations are completed (committed), or none of them are (rolled back). This ensures that the database is always left in a consistent state.

Here's a diagram that shows the typical workflow of a transaction in JDBC:

```

In JDBC, every `Connection` has an associated transaction. By default, each SQL statement is automatically committed as soon as it finishes. This is known as auto-commit mode. However, you can disable auto-commit and manage the transaction manually.

To start a transaction, you disable auto-commit on the `Connection`:
```java
conn.setAutoCommit(false);
```

From this point on, no SQL statements will be committed until you explicitly call the `commit()` method:
```java
conn.commit();
```

If at any point you decide to abort the transaction, you can call the `rollback()` method, which will undo all the changes made since the start of the transaction:
```java
conn.rollback();
```

It's important to always either commit or roll back a transaction. If you disable auto-commit, start a transaction, and then close the `Connection` without committing or rolling back, the behavior will be undefined. The changes might be committed, or they might be rolled back, or they might be left in limbo, depending on the database and the JDBC driver. To avoid this uncertainty always explicitly commit or roll back before closing the `Connection`.

Here's a typical pattern for using transactions:
```java
try {
    conn.setAutoCommit(false);
    // execute some SQL statements
    conn.commit();
} catch (SQLException e) {
    conn.rollback();
} finally {
    conn.setAutoCommit(true);
}
```

The `finally` block ensures that auto-commit is re-enabled, even if an exception occurs.

### Savepoints
Sometimes, you might want to partially roll back a transaction. For example, suppose a transaction consists of three SQL statements. After executing the first two statements, you encounter an error. You want to roll back the second statement, but keep the changes made by the first statement.

This is where savepoints come in. A savepoint is a named bookmark within a transaction. You can roll back to a savepoint without aborting the entire transaction.

Here's how it works:
```java
Savepoint sp1 = conn.setSavepoint();
// execute first statement

Savepoint sp2 = conn.setSavepoint();
// execute second statement

if (error) {
    conn.rollback(sp2);
}

// execute third statement

conn.commit();
```

In this example, if an error occurs after the second statement, we roll back to the `sp2` savepoint, which discards the changes made by the second statement but keeps the changes made by the first statement. We then proceed with the third statement and commit the transaction.

Transactions are a powerful tool for ensuring data integrity, but they also come with some overhead. Opening a transaction, committing it, and rolling it back all involve communication with the database server, which can be slow. Therefore, it's generally best to keep transactions as short as possible, and only use them when necessary for maintaining data consistency.


## Closing the Connection
When you're done with your database work, it's essential to properly close all the resources you've opened: `Connections`, `Statements`, `PreparedStatements`, `CallableStatements`, and `ResultSets`. Failing to close these resources can lead to resource leaks, which can severely impact the performance and scalability of your application.

Think of it like borrowing books from a library. If you keep borrowing books without ever returning them, eventually the library will run out of books for other people to borrow. Similarly, if you keep opening database resources without closing them, eventually the database will run out of resources to allocate to other connections.

However, always keep in mind that the order matters. It's not enough to just close the resources, you need to close them in the right order. The rule of thumb is to close the resources in the reverse order of their creation.

Here's the typical order:

1. Close the `ResultSet` (if there is one)
2. Close the `Statement`, `PreparedStatement`, or `CallableStatement`
3. Close the `Connection`

This order is important because of the way these resources are related:

- A `Connection` can have multiple `Statements`, `PreparedStatements`, and `CallableStatements`.
- A `Statement`, `PreparedStatement`, or `CallableStatement` can have at most one associated `ResultSet`.

Therefore:

- Closing a `Connection` automatically closes all the `Statements`, `PreparedStatements`, and `CallableStatements` created from it.
- Closing a `Statement`, `PreparedStatement`, or `CallableStatement` automatically closes its associated `ResultSet` (if there is one).

Here's an example that demonstrates the proper closing order:
```java
ResultSet rs = null;
PreparedStatement pstmt = null;
Connection conn = null;

try {
    conn = DriverManager.getConnection(url, user, password);
    pstmt = conn.prepareStatement(sql);
    rs = pstmt.executeQuery();
    // process the results
} catch (SQLException e) {
    // handle the exception
} finally {
    if (rs != null) {
        try {
            rs.close();
        } catch (SQLException e) {
            // log the exception
        }
    }
    if (pstmt != null) {
        try {
            pstmt.close();
        } catch (SQLException e) {
            // log the exception  
        }
    }
    if (conn != null) {
        try {
            conn.close();
        } catch (SQLException e) {
            // log the exception
        }
    }
}
```

Notice that we close the resources in the finally block. This ensures that they get closed even if an exception occurs. Note that each `close()` call is wrapped in its own `try-catch` block. This is because the `close()` method can also throw a `SQLException`, and we don't want that to prevent the other resources from being closed. Also, the code checks if the resources are `null` first, to avoid a `NullPointerException` if the resources were never initialized.

However, you can use the `try-with-resources` statement to automatically close resources:
```java
try (Connection conn = DriverManager.getConnection(url, user, password);
     PreparedStatement pstmt = conn.prepareStatement(sql);
     ResultSet rs = pstmt.executeQuery()) {
    // process the results
} catch (SQLException e) {
    // handle the exception
}
```

The `try-with-resources` statement automatically closes the resources in the reverse order of their declaration, even if an exception occurs. This is the preferred way to handle JDBC resources because it greatly simplifies your code and make it more readable.


## Key Points

- JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) is an API for accessing relational databases from Java programs.

- The core JDBC interfaces are `Driver`, `Connection`, `Statement`, `PreparedStatement`, `CallableStatement`, and `ResultSet`.

- An `SQLException` is thrown to provide information on database access errors. Its methods `getMessage()`, `getSQLState()`, and `getErrorCode()` provide details about the error.

- A JDBC URL contains the information needed to locate and access the database, in the format `jdbc:{driver-name}://{server-name}:{port}/{database-name}`.

- A `Connection` object can be obtained from a JDBC URL using `DriverManager.getConnection()` or from a `DataSource` object.

- A `Statement` is used for simple SQL queries without parameters. A `PreparedStatement` is used for precompiled SQL statements with or without parameters. A `CallableStatement` is used to execute stored procedures.

- A `ResultSet` represents the rows and columns returned from a SQL query. Data can be retrieved from a `ResultSet` using getter methods like `getInt()`, `getString()`, etc.

- By default, a `ResultSet` is forward-only (`ResultSet.TYPE_FORWARD_ONLY`) and read-only (`ResultSet.CONCUR_READ_ONLY`), but it can be made scrollable and updatable.

- Transactions ensure data consistency by treating a sequence of database operations as a single unit of work. They are controlled by `setAutoCommit()`, `commit()`, and `rollback()`.

- Savepoints allow for partial rollbacks within a transaction.

- Always close `ResultSets`, `Statements`, and `Connections` in the reverse order of their creation to prevent resource leaks, either manually in a `finally` block or by using a `try-with-resources` block.
