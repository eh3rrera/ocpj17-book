## Basic Concepts of Annotations

In Java, annotations are a form of metadata that we can add to our code. They don't directly affect the operation of the code they annotate, but they can be used to provide information to the compiler, to tools that process the code, or even to other developers reading the code.

Here's a simple example of an annotation:

```java
@Override
public void myMethod() {
    // Method implementation
}
```

In this case, `@Override` is an annotation that tells the compiler that this method is intended to override a method in a superclass. If it doesn't actually override a method, the compiler will generate an error.

The syntax of an annotation is simple: it starts with an `@` symbol, followed by the annotation name. Some annotations can also take parameters. Here are a few examples:

```java
@SuppressWarnings("unchecked")
@Deprecated
@CustomAnnotation(name = "John Doe", date = "2024-07-26")
```

The first annotation, `@SuppressWarnings`, takes a single parameter. The second, `@Deprecated`, is a marker annotation that doesn't take any parameters. The third, `@CustomAnnotation`, is a custom annotation that takes multiple parameters.

You can apply annotations to various elements in your Java code:

- Classes
- Methods
- Fields
- Parameters
- Local variables
- Packages

Here's an example showing annotations in different contexts:

```java
@Entity
public class MyClass {
    @Id
    private Long id;

    @Deprecated
    public void oldMethod() {}

    public void newMethod(@NotNull String param) {
        @SuppressWarnings("unused")
        int localVar = 0;
    }
}
```

Java supports three main types of annotations:

1. Marker Annotations: These don't have any parameters. They're used to simply mark an element. For example, `@Override`.

2. Single-Value Annotations: These have a single parameter. For example, `@SuppressWarnings("unchecked")`.

3. Multi-Value Annotations: These have multiple parameters. For example, `@CustomAnnotation` from a previous example.

### Custom Annotations

To define a custom annotation, we use the `@interface` keyword. This tells Java that we're creating an annotation type, not a regular interface. Here's the basic structure:

```java
public @interface MyAnnotation {
    // Annotation elements go here
}
```

Now, this creates a very basic annotation that doesn't do much. To make it more useful, we need to add some elements. These elements are declared as methods without a body:

```java
public @interface MyAnnotation {
    String value();
    int count() default 1;
}
```

In this example, we've defined two elements: `value` of type `String`, and `count` of type `int` with a default value of 1. When using this annotation, we'd need to provide a value for the `value` element, but `count` is optional because it has a default value.

Let's break down the structure of an annotation definition:

1. Access modifier: Usually `public`, so it can be used from other packages.
2. `@interface` keyword: This is what makes it an annotation type.
3. Annotation name: Following Java naming conventions, typically starting with a capital letter.
4. Annotation elements: Defined as method-like declarations.

Now, we can use annotations on our annotation. They're called meta-annotations, and they provide information about how our annotation should be used and processed.

The two most common meta-annotations are `@Retention` and `@Target`. Let's look at them in more detail:

```java
import java.lang.annotation.*;

@Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
@Target(ElementType.METHOD)
public @interface MyAnnotation {
    String value();
    int count() default 1;
}
```

The `@Retention` annotation specifies how long our annotation should be retained. It can take one of three values:

- `RetentionPolicy.SOURCE`: The annotation is discarded by the compiler.
- `RetentionPolicy.CLASS`: The annotation is recorded in the class file but not available at runtime. This is the default.
- `RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME`: The annotation is recorded in the class file and available at runtime through reflection.

The `@Target` annotation specifies where our annotation can be used. It can take one or more `ElementType` values. These are the most commonly used:

- `ElementType.TYPE`: Can be applied to classes, interfaces, or enums.
- `ElementType.FIELD`: Can be applied to fields.
- `ElementType.METHOD`: Can be applied to methods.
- `ElementType.PARAMETER`: Can be applied to method parameters.
- `ElementType.CONSTRUCTOR`: Can be applied to constructors.
- `ElementType.LOCAL_VARIABLE`: Can be applied to local variables.
- `ElementType.ANNOTATION_TYPE`: Can be applied to other annotations.
- `ElementType.PACKAGE`: Can be applied to packages.

Here's an example of a more complex annotation:

```java
import java.lang.annotation.*;

@Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
@Target({ElementType.METHOD, ElementType.TYPE})
public @interface TestInfo {
    String[] tags() default {};
    String createdBy() default "Unknown";
    String lastModified();
}
```

This example:

1. Sets the retention policy to `RUNTIME`, so this annotation will be available for reflection at runtime.
2. Sets the target to both `METHOD` and `TYPE`, so this annotation can be used on methods and classes/interfaces/enums.
3. Defines three elements:
   - `tags`: An array of Strings with an empty default value.
   - `createdBy`: A String with a default value of `"Unknown"`.
   - `lastModified`: A String with no default value, so it must be specified when the annotation is used.

We could use this annotation like this:

```java
@TestInfo(tags = {"unit", "integration"}, lastModified = "2024-07-26")
public class MyTestClass {
    @TestInfo(createdBy = "John Doe", lastModified = "2024-07-27")
    public void testMethod() {
        // Test implementation
    }
}
```

However, Java provides several built-in annotations that we can use directly. In the next sections, we'll look at a few of them.


## The @Override Annotation

The `@Override` annotation is used to indicate that a method in a subclass is intended to override a method in its superclass or implement a method from an interface. 

But why do we need this? Can't we just override methods without it?

Well, yes, we can. But the `@Override` annotation serves two purposes:

1. It acts as a safety net, catching errors at compile-time.
2. It improves code readability, making our intentions clear to other developers (including our future selves).

Using `@Override` is straightforward. You simply place it above the method that's supposed to override a superclass method or implement an interface method. Here's an example:

```java
class Animal {
    public void makeSound() {
        System.out.println("Some generic animal sound");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    @Override
    public void makeSound() {
        System.out.println("Woof!");
    }
}
```

In this case, `Dog` is overriding the `makeSound()` method from `Animal`. The `@Override` annotation tells the compiler to check if we're actually overriding a method from a superclass or implementing a method from an interface.

Here are the two most common mistakes this annotation can help you catch (flagging them as compile-time errors):

1. Misspelling the method name:

```java
class Dog extends Animal {
    @Override
    public void makSound() { // Forgot the 'e' in 'make'
        System.out.println("Woof!");
    }
}
```

2. Using the wrong parameter types:

```java
class Animal {
    public void eat(String food) {
        System.out.println("Eating " + food);
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    @Override
    public void eat(int amount) { // Wrong parameter type
        System.out.println("Eating " + amount + " units of food");
    }
}
```

However, if you annotate a static method with `@Override`, you'll get a compile-time error:

```java
class Animal {
    public static void sleep() {
        System.out.println("Zzz...");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    @Override  // Error: Static methods cannot be annotated with @Override
    public static void sleep() {
        System.out.println("Dog sleeping... Zzz...");
    }
}
```

Regarding best practices:

1. Always use `@Override` when you intend to override a method. It's a small effort that can save you from subtle bugs.

2. If you're implementing an interface method, using `@Override` is optional but recommended. It helps to catch errors if the interface changes.

3. Use `@Override` even in abstract classes when overriding abstract methods. It helps maintain consistency and can catch errors if the superclass changes.

4. When overriding `equals()`, `hashCode()`, or `toString()` from `Object`, always use `@Override`. These methods are easy to get wrong, and `@Override` provides an extra layer of safety.


## The @FunctionalInterface Annotation

The `@FunctionalInterface` annotation was introduced in Java 8 to designate an interface as a functional interface. These interfaces are the cornerstone of functional programming in Java, as they can be implemented using lambda expressions or method references.

Here's a simple example:

```java
@FunctionalInterface
public interface Greeting {
    void sayHello(String name);
}
```

A functional interface must have the following characteristics:

1. It must be an interface (not a class or enum).
2. It must have exactly one abstract method.

However, it can also have:
- Any number of default methods
- Any number of static methods
- Methods from the `Object` class

For example, this is still a valid functional interface:

```java
@FunctionalInterface
public interface AdvancedGreeting {
    void sayHello(String name); // The single abstract method

    default void sayGoodbye(String name) {
        System.out.println("Goodbye, " + name + "!");
    }

    static void printGreeting() {
        System.out.println("This is a greeting interface");
    }
}
```

The real power of `@FunctionalInterface` comes from its ability to enforce the functional interface contract at compile-time. For example, if you try to add a second abstract method to a `@FunctionalInterface` annotated interface, the compiler will throw an error:

```java
@FunctionalInterface
public interface InvalidGreeting {
    void sayHello(String name);
    void sayGoodbye(String name); // Compile-time error!
}
```

Java provides several built-in functional interfaces in the `java.util.function` package. Here's an example using `Predicate`:

```java
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.List;
import java.util.function.Predicate;

public class PredicateExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<String> names = Arrays.asList("John", "Jane", "Jack", "Joe");

        Predicate<String> startsWithJ = name -> name.startsWith("J");

        names.stream()
             .filter(startsWithJ)
             .forEach(System.out::println);
    }
}
```

When working with functional interfaces, keep these tips in mind:

1. Always use the `@FunctionalInterface` annotation when defining a functional interface. It's not strictly necessary, but it helps catch errors and communicates your intent.

2. Keep your functional interfaces focused on a single operation. If you need multiple operations, consider using multiple interfaces or a more traditional object-oriented approach.

3. Consider using the built-in functional interfaces in `java.util.function` before creating your own. They cover many common use cases and promote consistency across codebases.

4. When using lambda expressions, keep them short and readable. If a lambda gets too complex, consider refactoring it into a named method.

5. Remember that functional interfaces can have default and static methods. Use these to provide utility methods or default behaviors when appropriate.


## The @Deprecated Annotation

In the world of software development, things are always changing. New, better ways of doing things are discovered, security vulnerabilities are found, or design decisions are reconsidered. When this happens, we often want to phase out old code gradually. That's where deprecation comes in.

Deprecation is a way of saying, "Hey, this piece of code is still here, but you probably shouldn't use it anymore. We have better alternatives now, or we're planning to remove it in the future."

In Java, we use the `@Deprecated` annotation to mark code as deprecated. Here's a simple example:

```java
public class OldCalculator {
    @Deprecated
    public int add(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }

    public int subtract(int a, int b) {
        return a - b;
    }
}
```

When you use the `add` method, your IDE will likely show a warning, and if you compile with certain settings, you'll see a warning message.

However, the code still works. The `@Deprecated` annotation doesn't change the functionality of the code. It's just a heads-up to developers that they should look for alternatives.

This annotation has two attributes, `since` and `forRemoval`:
```java
@Deprecated(since = "9", forRemoval = true)
public void oldMethod() {
    // Method implementation
}
```

The `since` attribute lets you specify in which version the element was deprecated, and `forRemoval` indicates whether the element is planned for removal in a future version.

When you're deprecating your own code, it's important to provide information about why it's being deprecated and what alternatives are available. Here's how you might do that:

```java
/**
 * Adds two integers.
 * 
 * @deprecated As of release 2.0, replaced by {@link NewCalculator#sum(int, int)}
 * This method doesn't handle integer overflow correctly.
 */
@Deprecated(since = "2.0", forRemoval = true)
public int add(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}
```

In this example, we're using both the annotation and the Javadoc to provide comprehensive information about the deprecation.

So here are some best practices to keep in mind:

1. Always provide a reason for the deprecation in the Javadoc.
2. If possible, suggest an alternative method or class to use instead.
3. Use the `since` attribute to indicate when the deprecation occurred.
4. Use the `forRemoval` attribute to signal if and when the element will be removed.
5. Don't remove deprecated elements without warning. Give your users time to update their code.
6. Consider your deprecation policy carefully. Frequent deprecations can frustrate users of your API.


## The @SuppressWarnings Annotation
Have you ever been working on a Java project and found your IDE littered with yellow warning squiggles? Sometimes these warnings are helpful, but other times they can be a bit overzealous. That's where the `@SuppressWarnings` annotation comes in handy. The annotation tells the compiler to suppress specific warnings that it would otherwise generate. It's like telling your IDE, "I know what I'm doing here, so please stop telling me about it."

Here is a simple example:

```java
@SuppressWarnings("deprecation")
public void oldMethod() {
    // Using some deprecated code here
    OldClass.doSomething();
}
```

In this case, we're telling the compiler to suppress any deprecation warnings in this method.

Java supports various types of warnings that can be suppressed. Here are some common ones:

1. `"deprecation"`: Suppresses warnings about deprecated elements.
2. `"unchecked"`: Suppresses warnings related to unchecked type conversions.
3. `"rawtypes"`: Suppresses warnings about using raw types.
4. `"unused"`: Suppresses warnings about unused code.
5. `"null"`: Suppresses warnings about null analysis.

You can suppress multiple warning types at once:

```java
@SuppressWarnings({"deprecation", "unchecked"})
public void multiWarningMethod() {
    // Method implementation
}
```

The scope of `@SuppressWarnings` depends on where you place it. You can apply it to:

- A single variable declaration
- A method
- A class
- Even a package (in the `package-info.java` file)

Here's an example showing different scopes:

```java
public class WarningExample {
    @SuppressWarnings("unused")
    private int unusedField;

    @SuppressWarnings("deprecation")
    public void deprecatedMethod() {
        // Using deprecated code
    }

    public void mixedWarnings() {
        @SuppressWarnings("unchecked")
        List rawList = new ArrayList();

        @SuppressWarnings("unused")
        int unusedVariable = 10;

        // More code...
    }
}
```

Best practice is to use `@SuppressWarnings` on the smallest possible scope. This ensures that you're only suppressing warnings where absolutely necessary and not accidentally hiding important warnings elsewhere in your code.

While `@SuppressWarnings` can be useful, it's important to use it judiciously. Here are some things to consider:

1. Don't use it as a band-aid: If you're suppressing a lot of warnings, it might be a sign that you need to refactor your code.

2. Document your suppressions: When you use `@SuppressWarnings`, it's a good idea to leave a comment explaining why the suppression is necessary.

3. Be specific: Use the most specific warning type possible. Avoid using `@SuppressWarnings("all")` as it suppresses all warnings and can hide important issues.

4. Regularly review suppressions. As your code evolves, some suppressions may become unnecessary. Regularly review and remove unneeded suppressions.

Let's look at a more complex example to see how these considerations play out in practice:

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

public class ComplexWarningExample {
    @SuppressWarnings("deprecation")
    public void legacyMethod() {
        // Using a deprecated API for backward compatibility
        OldAPI.doSomething();
    }

    @SuppressWarnings({"rawtypes", "unchecked"})
    public List getItems() {
        // TODO: Refactor this method to use generics
        List items = new ArrayList();
        items.add("item1");
        items.add("item2");
        return items;
    }

    public void processData() {
        @SuppressWarnings("unused")
        int dataCount = 0; // Will be used in future implementation

        // Suppressing unchecked warning for this specific operation
        @SuppressWarnings("unchecked")
        List<String> data = (List<String>) loadData();

        // Process data...
    }

    @SuppressWarnings("all") // Be very careful with this!
    private Object loadData() {
        // This method needs a comprehensive refactor
        // Suppressing all warnings temporarily until refactoring is complete
        // FIXME: Refactor this method by next sprint
        // ...
    }
}
```

In this example:

1. We suppress deprecation warnings in `legacyMethod()` because we're intentionally using an old API for backward compatibility.

2. In `getItems()`, we suppress `rawtype` and `unchecked` warnings, but we also leave a `TODO` comment indicating that this should be refactored.

3. In `processData()`, we suppress an `unused` variable warning for `dataCount`, explaining that it will be used in the future. We also suppress an unchecked warning for a specific cast operation.

4. In `loadData()`, we suppress all warnings, but we've left a clear `FIXME` comment indicating that this is temporary and needs to be addressed soon.

Remember, every time you use `@SuppressWarnings`, you're taking on a bit of technical debt. Sometimes this is necessary, but always be mindful of it and try to pay it off when you can.



## The @SafeVarargs Annotation

Have you ever worked with varargs in Java and encountered warnings about "unchecked or unsafe operations"? If so, you've probably come across a situation where the `@SafeVarargs` annotation could be useful. But before talking about the annotation itself, let's refresh our memory on what varargs are.

Varargs (variable-length arguments) allow a method to accept an arbitrary number of arguments. They're declared using an ellipsis (`...`) after the type. For example:

```java
public void printAll(String... args) {
    for (String arg : args) {
        System.out.println(arg);
    }
}
```

This method can be called with any number of String arguments:

```java
printAll("Hello", "World");
printAll("One", "Two", "Three", "Four");
```

Now, the problem arises when we combine varargs with generics. Let's look at an example:

```java
public static <T> void processItems(T... items) {
    for (T item : items) {
        // Process each item
    }
}
```

This looks innocent enough, but it can lead to heap pollution, a situation where a variable of a parameterized type refers to an object that's not of that parameterized type. The compiler will warn us about this potential issue.

That's where `@SafeVarargs` comes in. It's a way of telling the compiler, "I've checked this method, and I promise it's safe to use with varargs."

However, it's important to understand that `@SafeVarargs` doesn't actually make an unsafe method safe. It's a promise from you, the developer, that the method is already safe. The compiler trusts you on this.

The `@SafeVarargs` annotation can be used on:

1. Static methods
2. Final instance methods (including private instance methods)
3. Constructors

Here's an example of how we might use it:

```java
public class SafeVarargsExample<T> {
    @SafeVarargs
    public static <T> List<T> asList(T... elements) {
        return Arrays.asList(elements);
    }

    @SafeVarargs
    private final <T> void printAll(T... elements) {
        for (T element : elements) {
            System.out.println(element);
        }
    }

    @SafeVarargs
    public SafeVarargsExample(T... elements) {
        // Constructor implementation
    }
}
```

`@SafeVarargs` needs to be used carefully. Here are some important rules and limitations:

1. Only use `@SafeVarargs` if you're absolutely sure the method is type-safe.
2. Don't use it on methods that aren't `final`, `static`, or constructors. Why? Because non-final methods can be overridden, potentially breaking the safety guarantee.
3. Be particularly careful when the varargs parameter is used to create an array of type `T`, or when it's stored in a data structure.

Let's look at some examples to illustrate safe and unsafe uses:

```java
public class SafeVarargsExamples {
    // Safe use of varargs
    @SafeVarargs
    public static <T> List<T> safeMethod(T... elements) {
        return Arrays.asList(elements); // Safe: we're not modifying the array
    }

    // Unsafe use of varargs
    @SafeVarargs // Warning: this use of @SafeVarargs is actually unsafe!
    public static <T> T[] unsafeMethod(T... elements) {
        return elements; // Unsafe: directly returning the varargs array
    }

    // Another unsafe example
    @SafeVarargs // Also unsafe!
    public static <T> void printArray(T... array) {
        Object[] objArray = array; // This is actually an unsafe cast
        objArray[0] = "Hello"; // This could cause a ClassCastException at runtime
        System.out.println(array[0]);
    }
}
```

In the `unsafeMethod`, we're directly returning the varargs parameter. This can lead to heap pollution because the returned array might not actually be of type `T[]`.

In the `printArray` method, we're performing an unsafe cast and then modifying the array. This could lead to a `ClassCastException` at runtime if the actual type of the array elements isn't compatible with the assigned value.

So when using `@SafeVarargs`, keep these best practices in mind:

1. Only use it when absolutely necessary. If you can avoid using generic varargs, that's often the safest approach.
2. When you do use it, document why the method is safe. This helps other developers (including future you) understand your reasoning.
3. Be extra cautious when storing varargs parameters in data structures or returning them directly.
4. Remember that `@SafeVarargs` is about suppressing warnings, not actually making unsafe code safe. Always ensure the underlying code is truly safe before using this annotation.

Here's an example putting these practices together:

```java
public class SafeVarargsBestPractices {
    /**
     * Safely combines multiple lists into one.
     * This method is safe because it only reads from the varargs parameter
     * and doesn't store it or perform any operations that could lead to heap pollution.
     *
     * @param lists The lists to combine
     * @return A new list containing all elements from the input lists
     */
    @SafeVarargs
    public static <T> List<T> combineLists(List<T>... lists) {
        List<T> result = new ArrayList<>();
        for (List<T> list : lists) {
            result.addAll(list);
        }
        return result;
    }
}
```


## Key Points

- Annotations are a form of metadata added to Java code that don't directly affect code operation but provide information to the compiler, development tools, or runtime environments.

- Annotations can be applied to classes, methods, fields, parameters, local variables, and packages.

- There are three main types of annotations:
  1. Marker Annotations: No parameters (such as `@Override`)
  2. Single-Value Annotations: One parameter (such as `@SuppressWarnings("unchecked")`)
  3. Multi-Value Annotations: Multiple parameters

- Custom annotations are defined using the `@interface` keyword.

- Meta-annotations like `@Retention` and `@Target` provide information about how and where annotations can be used.

- The `@Override` annotation:
  - Indicates a method is intended to override a superclass method or implement an interface method.
  - Helps catch errors at compile-time and improves code readability.
  - Cannot be used on static methods.

- The `@FunctionalInterface` annotation:
  - Designates an interface as a functional interface (exactly one abstract method).
  - Allows implementation using lambda expressions or method references.
  - Can have any number of default or static methods.

- The `@Deprecated` annotation:
  - Marks code as obsolete or not recommended for use.
  - Has `since` and `forRemoval` attributes to specify deprecation details.
  - Should be accompanied by Javadoc explaining the reason for deprecation and suggesting alternatives.

- The `@SuppressWarnings` annotation:
  - Tells the compiler to suppress specific warnings.
  - Common types: `"deprecation"`, `"unchecked"`, `"rawtypes"`, `"unused"`, `"null"`.
  - Should be used on the smallest possible scope and with caution.

- The `@SafeVarargs` annotation:
  - Used with generic varargs to suppress unchecked warnings.
  - Can only be applied to static methods, final instance methods, and constructors.
  - Doesn't make unsafe code safe; it's a promise from the developer that the method is already safe.
  - Should be used carefully, especially when varargs parameters are stored or returned directly.

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Processor upperCase = s -> s.toUpperCase();
        System.out.println(upperCase.process("hello"));
    }
}
```

**A)** The code will not compile because `@FunctionalInterface` requires exactly two abstract methods.  
**B)** The `@FunctionalInterface` annotation ensures that the interface can have multiple abstract methods.  
**C)** The code will not compile because `@FunctionalInterface` cannot be used with interfaces that have default methods.  
**D)** The code will compile and run, outputting `"HELLO"` to the console.  
**E)** The code will compile but throw a runtime exception when trying to use a lambda expression with `Processor`.


**4. Which of the following statements about the `@Deprecated` annotation is correct?**

**A)** `@Deprecated` causes the compiler to remove the annotated element from the compiled bytecode.  
**B)** `@Deprecated` can only be applied to methods and fields, not classes or interfaces.  
**C)** `@Deprecated(since="17", forRemoval=true)` indicates that the annotated element is deprecated and is scheduled for removal in a future version.  
**D)** Using a deprecated element in your code will always result in a compile-time error.  
**E)** `@Deprecated` automatically provides a replacement for the deprecated element.


**5. Consider the following code snippet. Which statement accurately describes the use of the `@SuppressWarnings` annotation in this context?**

```java
public class WarningExample {
    @SuppressWarnings("deprecation")
    public void legacyMethod() {
        Date date = new Date(2024, 0, 1);
        System.out.println(date);
    }
    
    @SuppressWarnings({"unchecked", "rawtypes"})
    public void genericMethod() {
        List list = new ArrayList();
        list.add("Hello");
        list.add(123);
    }
}
```

**A)** The `@SuppressWarnings("deprecation")` annotation will prevent compiler warnings about the use of the deprecated `Date` constructor.  
**B)** The `@SuppressWarnings` annotation in `genericMethod()` will cause a compile-time error due to incorrect syntax.  
**C)** The `@SuppressWarnings("deprecation")` annotation will automatically update the code to use non-deprecated methods.  
**D)** The `@SuppressWarnings` annotations in this code will suppress all compiler warnings for the entire class.  
**E)** The `@SuppressWarnings({"unchecked", "rawtypes"})` annotation is unnecessary because the code in `genericMethod()` is type-safe.


**6. Which of the following statements about the `@SafeVarargs` annotation is correct?**

**A)** The `@SafeVarargs` annotation automatically checks for type safety violations at runtime.  
**B)** `@SafeVarargs` can be applied to `private` instance methods, in addition to `static` methods, `final` instance methods, and constructors.  
**C)** Using `@SafeVarargs` on a method prevents it from being overridden in subclasses.  
**D)** `@SafeVarargs` is required on all methods that use generic varargs to ensure type safety.
